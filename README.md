# Dependencies:
Ensure that you have all required dependencies to use this resource. I may include support for other dependencies on request. Just send me a message on discord at: sprigo_1
- ox_inventory
- ox_lib
- qbx_core

# Installation:
Installation is simple! Follow the below steps 
1. Download the resource by navigating to the releases or downloading the code from the button on the top right hand side.
2. Drag the resource into your FiveM resource list.
3. Add the following string to your server.cfg, near the bottom: `ensure springo-gasmask`
4. Navigate to the 'install' folder and locate the items.lua file. Copy the entire contents of the file and past it at the bottom of your ox_inventory/data/items.lua file. Make sure your commas all line up with proper lua syntax.
5. Navigate to the `install` folder and locate the image file. Copy the image into your ox_inventory/web/html/images so that an image displays on item usage.
6. Open the config.lua and adjust whatever you want to. The script is open source, so if you have coding knowledge, adjust what you want to as you see fit. Lots of potential with this script, can add vomiting potential if the player is in smoke for too long with the gas mask on, can gradually reduce the gas mask over time, so it degrades quicker via ox_inventory, etc. The possibilities are endless. 
That's it, you now have an official working gas mask in your FiveM server.
